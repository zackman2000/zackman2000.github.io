    <p class="centertext">This year was another busy one with Black and White again along with Prom and Disney. I can't</p>
    <p class="centertext">believe we made it this far together. Three years together and on to the fourth. We've done</p>
    <p class="centertext">everything together for as long as I can remember and can't wait to continue to in the future.</p>
    <p class="centertext">We'll have to separate in a couple months and I'm dreading that day but we will keep this going</p>
    <p class="centertext">until the day we die. We are perfect for each other and I can't be without you.</p>
    <p class="centertext">I love you Juliette, so much.</p>
